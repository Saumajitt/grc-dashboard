# GRC Dashboard

A prototype dashboard to optimize common workflows for **GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) professionals**, focused on **evidence management** and **third-party risk management (TPRM)**.  

Built with **Next.js (frontend)**, **Node.js/Express (backend)**, and **MongoDB (database)**. Designed for scalability, modularity, and ease of extension with microservices.

---

## Problem Statement

GRC professionals face two recurring workflow inefficiencies:

1. **Evidence Upload Issue**  
   - Evidence files (e.g., policies, diagrams, documents) must currently be uploaded one by one.  
   - This is inefficient, especially for multiple files belonging to the same category (e.g., "Encryption Policies").

2. **Bulk Upload Issue**  
   - Onboarding multiple third-party organizations requires manual search/entry.  
   - This is time-consuming and error-prone.

---

## Current Status (Achieved So Far)

**Backend:**

- User registration & login with JWT authentication (role-based: admin/client).  
- **Evidence Upload API** supporting multi-file uploads (up to 10 files per request).  
  - Files are stored locally (`/uploads`) with timestamped filenames.  
  - Each file is associated with the uploader.  
- **Get Evidence API**:  
  - Normal users fetch **only their uploaded evidence**.  
  - Pagination, sorting (newest first), and filtering by category are implemented.  
  - Populates `uploadedBy` field for clarity.  
- **Third-Party Bulk Upload API**:  
  - Accepts CSV files, normalizes headers (lowercase/uppercase), validates data, and stores in MongoDB.  
- MongoDB fully connected; collections include `users`, `evidence`, and `thirdparties`.

**Frontend (Planned/Setup):**

- Next.js + React project scaffolded.
- Dashboard layout (sidebar, pages) planned.

**Tested Workflows:**

1. Register a normal user (`client`) and upload multiple evidence files in a single batch.  
2. Get uploaded evidence and verify pagination, sorting, and filtering.  
3. Bulk upload CSV of third-party organizations with proper validation and error reporting.  

---

## Proposed Solution / Next Steps

**Backend Enhancements:**

1. **Admin Endpoint**:
   - Fetch **all users**, **all evidence**, and **all third-party uploads**.  
   - Pagination, sorting, and filtering support.  
2. **Evidence Retrieval Filters**:
   - Allow more granular filtering (category, date range, uploader, etc.).  
3. **RBAC Middleware**:
   - Enforce role-based access control systematically.  
4. **Audit Logging**:
   - Track evidence uploads, downloads, and bulk operations.  
5. **File Validation**:
   - Check type and size before upload.  

**Frontend Goals:**

- Implement **professional dashboard** with:
  - Tables displaying evidence and third-party info.
  - Pagination controls.
  - Filters and sorting.
  - Upload forms (multi-file and CSV).

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express  
- **Database:** MongoDB (Mongoose for schemas/models)  
- **Auth:** JWT (role-based), OAuth2 extension planned  
- **File Upload:** Multer for multi-file uploads  
- **CSV Parsing:** csv-parser library

## ‚öñÔ∏è Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Summary

| Endpoint | Client Access | Admin Access |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| `/api/evidence/upload` | ‚úÖ own uploads | ‚úÖ all uploads |
| `/api/evidence` | ‚úÖ only own evidence | ‚úÖ all evidence |
| `/api/evidence/:id` | ‚úÖ update/delete own | ‚úÖ update/delete any |
| `/api/thirdparties` (all CRUD) | ‚ùå mostly restricted | ‚úÖ full access |
| `/api/users/profile` | ‚úÖ own profile & own evidence | ‚úÖ full dashboard with all users' uploads |
| `/api/users/logout` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |

**Key Points:**

- Clients cannot access other clients' uploads or third-party entries
- Admins have unrestricted access and can see all users' data
